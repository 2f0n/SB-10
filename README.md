# SB-10
An act introduced by California Senator Lara relating to immigration

> “Ignoring our immigrant communities is irresponsible and unrealistic, especially for a state that has the largest undocumented population in the country” said Senator Ricardo Lara. “That’s why I’m proposing the creation of the California Office of New Americans which will provide our undocumented population with resources, information, and fraud prevention assistance, helping them better integrate into the economic, social and political fabric of our state.”

and placement, and cash and medical assistance for refugees. 8 USC 1521 et seq. is intended to
promote the resettlement and economic self-sufficiency of refugees within the shortest time possible.

of Health and Human Services to approve alternative programs "...under which refugees are provided
interim support, medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that
encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the
resettlement agencies and service providers." Section 412(e)(7) of the Immigrationand NationalityAct,
8 U.S.C. 1522(e)(7). The Massachusetts Refugee Resettlement Program (MRRP) is such an
alternative program.

to accomplish this purpose by emphasizing coordination of services, early employment and postemployment
